  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Snake - Solana</strong> ("the app") is committed to transparency about data collection and protection.</p>

  <h2>Data we collect and use</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Wallet address:</strong> When you connect a wallet (e.g. via Seeker/Seed Vault or Phantom), we use your public wallet address to display your identity and to submit and display leaderboard scores. We do not store your private keys or seed phrase.</li>
    <li><strong>Game scores:</strong> If you submit scores, we store your wallet address, score, game mode, and difficulty in our leaderboard database (Supabase) so we can show rankings.</li>
    <li><strong>Display names:</strong> We may resolve your wallet address to a .skr or other display name for showing on the leaderboard; this uses public lookup data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data we do not collect</h2>
  <p>We do not collect personal data such as name, email, or phone number unless you provide it elsewhere. We do not track you across other sites or apps for advertising.</p>

  <h2>Third parties</h2>
  <p>Leaderboard data is stored with Supabase. Wallet connection is handled by your wallet provider (e.g. Phantom, Seeker/Seed Vault). Their privacy policies apply to that interaction.</p>

  <h2>Your choices</h2>
  <p>You can disconnect your wallet at any time from within the app. Leaderboard entries tied to your wallet address may remain in our database for the operation of the leaderboard.</p>

  <h2>Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy from time to time. The latest version will always be at this URL.</p>

  <p><strong>Contact:</strong> For questions about this privacy policy, contact us through the app's support or publisher contact information.</p>
  <p>Last updated: February 2026.</p>
